# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:June 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started on the first basic course on freeCodeCamp.org. I completed the first 51 steps of the lesson "Learn HTML by Building a Cat App"

**Thoughts:** I havent really messed with HTML since 2010, so its been pretty mind numbing relearning basic HTML. I'm unsure how much I will learn with this program at the moment, but hopefully, when I get furthur in I will catch some interest with the more advanced stuff. So far I am looking forward to learning back end development.

### Day 1:June 2nd, 2022 Part 2

**Today's Progress**: Continued on "Learn HTML by Building a Cat App" and finished the lesson.

**Thoughts:** I didn't really want to revisit this today, but I found an opputunity due to not having anything else to do at work.
